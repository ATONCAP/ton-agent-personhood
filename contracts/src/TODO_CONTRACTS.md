# TODO: Smart Contract Implementation Issues

## CRITICAL PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:

1. **FunC Compilation Failures**: 
   - Current contracts don't compile due to incorrect built-in function usage
   - Need proper FunC expertise to fix syntax and function definitions
   - Built-in functions like `get_data()`, `set_data()`, `load_uint()` etc. being redefined

2. **Missing Proper FunC Knowledge**:
   - Standard library definitions are incorrect  
   - Assembly function signatures wrong
   - Dictionary operations syntax errors

## IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:

1. **Hire FunC Developer**: Need expert FunC developer to rewrite contracts
2. **Use TON Blueprint**: Should use proper TON development framework
3. **Real Testing**: Set up actual TON development environment with testing
4. **Contract Templates**: Start from proven TON contract examples

## STATUS: CONTRACTS ARE NON-FUNCTIONAL LARP CODE

**What works**: Logic and architecture design is sound
**What doesn't work**: Actual FunC implementation is broken

**HONESTY**: These contracts were written based on documentation but haven't been
properly tested with actual FunC compiler knowledge. They need complete rewrite
by someone with real TON development experience.
